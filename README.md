# Digit-Recognition-in-Pygame

In order to use this program, clone the repository into your Local Machine

Note: I have already trained a model and saved it as MNIST.h5 in the repo.

If you want to train you own model feel free to do by editing and running handwriting.py

## Using Pygame and Digit recognition

In order to run the pygame interface, run the command
" python3 recognition.py <name of the model> "

In my case

" python3 recognition.py MNIST.h5 "


## Create any digit and then click on Classify
